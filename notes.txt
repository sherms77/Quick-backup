NOTES
260521: NEXT STEP: COPY FOLDER TO NEW FOLDER WITH TIME DATE STAMP - PART OF STEP 5.
260521: I have set up method to create new timedate folder name with each iteration. refer to str-fomat_test.py.
240521: Formatted timedate str. Refer to str-format_test.py.
240521: STILL WORKING ON str formatting. Refer to str-format_test.py.
210521: WORKING ON str formatting. Refer to str-format_test.py.
210521: Watched video in link 14 - string formatting.
210521: Still watching video in link 14 - string formatting.
190521: NEXT STEP: Finish watching string formatting video in point 14 in links. Shows how to add values into a string using .format function. Then code out and test.
190521: I need to know how to generate a new folder name within a string. Analyse the '%' string formatting operator to see how it works and if I can use it to achieve this.
170521: Refer to copy_test.py.
170521: trying to populate the end of the target path with the folder name generated in the directory variable. I get errors (refer above).
170521: Still working on step 5.
140521: STILL WORKING ON STEP 5. REFER TO copy_test.py.
140521: i still need to make the new folder name iterable. new name needs to be created each time.
140521: problem with workaround(below) is that the script will always contain the same folder name and when its copied to external drive there will be an error.
140521: Possible workaround is:
    1.copy to local drive (create new folder)
    2.copy to external drive
    3.delete backup from local drive.
140521: When copying from one folder to another using shutil.copytree, it needs create and copy to a new folder. It cannot copy to an existing folder.
120521: Finished step 4. NEXT: Keep working on step 5.
110521: NEXT STEP: MODIFY STEPS IN KANBAN BOARD ON GITHUB. THEN CONTINUE WORK ON STEP 5.
110521: Modified and reordered steps.
110521: Added flow of execution.
080521: Reassess steps, reorder as required. Do this before working on NEXT STEP below. Log file may not be required as folders are timestamped. Look at copying folders to newly created folder. use of '%' string formatting maybe required.
060521: NEXT STEP: Develop and test copying files to new timestamped folder using mkdir method.
060521: Integrated code from mkdir-test(2).py into quickbackup.py.
060521: NEXT STEP: Integrate code from mkdir-test(2).py into quickBackup.py.
060521: Modified steps. Step 8 became step 6. Step 6 is DONE.
060521: Fixed join() argument must be str error.
060521: Did not code out the rest of the example.
060521: Got to work as required. Creates new folder named with date time stamp everytime.
050521: Still trying to resolve str error (below). Look into file paths. Is example from link for windows or linux?
040521: NEXT STEP: Try to resolve join() argument must be str error. Refer to comments in mkdir-test(2).py. Work on it in Python IDLE.
040521: Ran mkdir-test(2).py in Python IDLE. Got error. Refer to Failed code section for error.
040521: Ran code in mkdir-test(2).py. Got error - bash: syntax error near unexpected token '('
030521: Started working on it again. Still working on step 8. Trying to work out how to create a new folder with each iteration (backup).
230421: Worked on step 8. Coding out example in mkdir-test(2).py. Refer to notes in file. Might run what I have coded so far to test and see how it works.
220421: DECIDED TO WORK ON STEP 8. Refer to Links 9 and 10 and mkdir(1).py and mkdir(2).py.
190421: Finsihed step 1. UP TO STEP 2.
update to save to external HDD - PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/media'
refer to /home/sherms/Python files/csv_import/csv_import.py
refer to /home/Python files/Python permission error for info about file permissions.

FLOW OF EXECUTION
1.Create target folder (for backup).
2.Copy folders to target folder.
3.For each backup, new target folder is created - target folder uses timedate stamp as name.

STEPS
1.write flow of execution - DONE

2.create kanban board in GitHub projects - DONE (Finished 190421)

3.make new target folder with timedate stamp as name - DONE
    note: cannot save to an existing folder
    a.need to work out method to create new folder each time or overwrite existing folder.
    b.possible method to create new folder names for target: use date+time stamp - concatenate to end of folder name
    c.replicate for each folder to copy

4.Modify steps in kanban board in GitHub to reflect steps here - DONE

5.copy files to target folder - DOING
    note: develop and test copying files to new timestamped folder using mkdir method.
    note 210521: working on string formatting. string formatting inserts timedate folder name at the end of target path, generating new folder name with each iteration.
    note 260521: I have set up method to create new timedate folder name with each iteration. refer to str-fomat_test.py.

6.test: repeat copy process to new target folder

7.copy to target drive
    a.need to find out how to give access to external HDD.
    b.need to change permissions so Python can access external drive - WD HDD 500GB PATH: /home/media/sherms/TARGET FOLDER

8.make file executable for linux: ELF file.
    a.after I have finished the program, make executable. elf (executable and linkable format) file in linux.

9.test - ELF file
