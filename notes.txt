NOTES
040521: NEXT STEP: Try to resolve join() argument must by str error. Refer to comments in mkdir-test(2).py. Work on it in Python IDLE.
040521: Ran mkdir-test(2).py in Python IDLE. Got error. Refer to Failed code section for error.
040521: Ran code in mkdir-test(2).py. Got error - bash: syntax error near unexpected token '('
030521: Started working on it again. Still working on step 8. Trying to work out how to create a new folder with each iteration (backup).
230421: Worked on step 8. Coding out example in mkdir-test(2).py. Refer to notes in file. Might run what I have coded so far to test and see how it works.
220421: DECIDED TO WORK ON STEP 8. Refer to Links 9 and 10 and mkdir(1).py and mkdir(2).py.
190421: Finsihed step 1. UP TO STEP 2.
update to save to external HDD - PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/media'
refer to /home/sherms/Python files/csv_import/csv_import.py
refer to /home/Python files/Python permission error for info about file permissions.

--Next steps:
1.create kanban board in GitHub projects - DONE (Finished step 1 190421)
2.backup script - DOING
3.need to find out how to give access to external HDD. - UP TO HERE
    a.need to change permissions so Python can access external drive - WD HDD 500GB PATH: /home/media/sherms/TARGET FOLDER
4.test backup script - DOING
5.log file.
6.test log file.
7.make file executable for linux - ELF file.
    a.after I have finished the program, make executable. elf (executable and linkable format) file in linux.
8.cannot save to an existing folder - need to work out method to create new folder each time or overwrite existing folder.
    a.possible method to create new folder names for target: use date+time stamp - concatenate to end of folder name
    b.replicate for each folder to copy
9.create log file
10.log file needs to print and save the lines of code executed instead of just printing a list of folders copied
11.save log file
