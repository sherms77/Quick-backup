NOTES
update to save to external HDD - PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/media'
refer to /home/sherms/Python files/csv_import/csv_import.py
refer to /home/Python files/Python permission error for info about file permissions.

--Next steps:
1.need to find out how to allow access.
2.need to change permissions so Python can access external drive - WD HDD 500GB
3.after I have finished the program, make executable. elf (executable and linkable format) file in linux.
4.cannot save to an existing folder - need to work out method to create new folder each time or overwrite existing folder.
5.possible method to create new folder names for target: use date+time stamp - concatenate to end of folder name
6.replicate for each folder to copy
7.create log file
8.log file needs to print and save the lines of code executed instead of just printing a list of folders copied
9.save log file
